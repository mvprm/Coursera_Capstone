For this project the problem I will adress is the one suggested and described below:

"In Module 3, we explored New York City and the city of Toronto and segmented and clustered their neighborhoods. 
Both cities are very diverse and are the financial capitals of their respective countries. 
One interesting idea would be to compare the neighborhoods of the two cities and determine how similar or dissimilar they are. 
Is New York City more like Toronto or Paris or some other multicultural city? I will leave it to you to refine this idea."

Essentially, some neighborhoods belonging to the cities of New York and Toronto will be compared to assess their similarity levels, in terms of financial strength.
